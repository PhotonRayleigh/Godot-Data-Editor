**Notice:** Since I've switched to Flutter, I've depreciated this project and will no longer be working on it.

A practice project to build a cross platform GUI desktop app for editing databases of various types.

This is very, VERY work in progress. Feel free to explore, but nothing is finished and half the stuff is experimental for learning purposes. Use at your own risk.
