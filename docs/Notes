1) ANY scripts you intend to run in the editor MUST
be annotated with [Tool]. Otherwise they won't work right.

2) C# scripts on resources seem to have marshalling bugs.
Trying to access members of a custom resource that is a member
of a custom resource seems to break within the editor.
Such calls work fine when running the application/game.

3) Godot is really crash happy if you re-build the solution
when your app is using custom resources.

4) Tool is really buggy if used improperly. Remember that
all scripts you need to run in the editor get annotated with
[Tool]. Also use Engine.EditorHint to selectively run code
depending on if it is in the context of the editor or not.

I think good practice will be to include editor code and
non-editor code for every scene, as needed. 

5) Any resources that are accessed by other [Tool] resources need to be marked
with [Tool] or they won't work.
